# Existing-table
One javascript table component with frozen columns and headers.

## Dependencies

- jQuery
- jQuery UI

## Demo
You can visit <https://galentian.github.io/existing-table/examples/index.html> to see features of existing-table.

## Browser Supported
Until now, existing-table supports these browsers (tested browsers):

- IE 9+
- Chrome*
- Firefox*
- Edge

> I don't mention the versions of Chrome & Firefox because I don't have previous versions of Chrome and Firefox. But theoretically, this table would work well on recent versions.
