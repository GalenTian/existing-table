# existing-table
One javascript table component with frozen columns and headers.

## Browser Supported
Until now, existing-table supports these browsers:

- IE 9+
- Chrome*
- Firefox*
- Edge

> I don't mention the versions of Chrome & Firefox because I don't have previous versions of Chrome and Firefox. But theoretically, this table would work well on latest versions of browsers.
